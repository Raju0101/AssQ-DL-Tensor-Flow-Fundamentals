    "TensorFlow, a popular open-source machine learning framework, employs various data structures to handle \n",
    "and manipulate data efficiently during the development of machine learning models. Some key data structures\n",
    "used in TensorFlow are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensors: Tensors are the fundamental building blocks in TensorFlow. They are multi-dimensional arrays that\n",
    "represent the data flowing through the computation graph. Tensors can be scalars (0-dimensional), vectors \n",
    "(1-dimensional), matrices (2-dimensional), or higher-dimensional arrays. For example, an image can be\n",
    "represented as a 3D tensor with dimensions (height, width, channels).\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables: TensorFlow Variables are mutable tensors used to store model parameters that are updated during \n",
    "training. They allow the model to learn and adapt over time. Variables are often used to hold weights and biases \n",
    "in neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constants: Constants are immutable tensors with fixed values that remain the same throughout the computation. \n",
    "They are typically used for values that don't change during model execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Placeholders: While TensorFlow 1.x used placeholders, TensorFlow 2.x introduced the tf.function decorator and \n",
    "Autograph, reducing the need for placeholders. Placeholders were used to feed data into a computation graph,\n",
    "often during training, but they've been replaced with more dynamic graph execution in newer versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Datasets: TensorFlow provides the tf.data.Dataset API to efficiently load and manipulate data for training and\n",
    "evaluation. Datasets can be created from various sources like arrays, files, or generators and can be transformed\n",
    "using operations like map, batch, and shuffle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sparse Tensors: These are tensors that store only non-zero values along with their indices, which is useful when\n",
    "dealing with sparse data like text data or embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "These structures collectively facilitate the efficient construction and execution of machine learning models in\n",

    "In TensorFlow, both constants and variables are essential data structures, but they serve different \n",
    "purposes in machine learning models. Let's delve into the differences using an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a simple linear regression model where we aim to find the best-fit line for a set of data\n",
    "points. The model equation is: y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the intercept.\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow Constant:\n",
    "A constant is an immutable tensor with a fixed value that remains the same throughout the computation. \n",
    "In the context of our linear regression model, if we know the value of x (input data) and b (intercept)\n",
    "beforehand and they won't change during training, we can use constants for these values. For instance,\n",
    "if x = 5 and b = 2, we can create constant tensors as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "\n",
    "x_constant = tf.constant(5.0, dtype=tf.float32)\n",
    "b_constant = tf.constant(2.0, dtype=tf.float32)\n",
    "TensorFlow Variable:\n",
    "A variable, on the other hand, is a mutable tensor used to store model parameters that are updated during training.\n",
    "In our linear regression example, m (slope) would be learned during training and would change over iterations to\n",

    "m_variable = tf.Variable(initial_value=0.0, dtype=tf.float32)\n",
    "Here, initial_value is the starting value of the variable.\n",

    "In summary, constants are used for values that remain unchanged during computation, while variables are used for\n",
    "learnable parameters that need to be updated during training to improve model performance. In our linear regression\n",
    "example, x_constant and b_constant remain fixed, while m_variable is adjusted during training. This differentiation\n",

    "TensorFlow provides a versatile set of operations for performing various matrix operations,\n",
    "such as addition, multiplication, and element-wise operations. Here's a brief overview of each process:\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix Addition:\n",
    "Matrix addition involves adding corresponding elements of two matrices to create a new matrix with\n",
    "the same dimensions. In TensorFlow, you can perform matrix addition using the tf.add() function.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "\n",
    "matrix_a = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n",
    "matrix_b = tf.constant([[5, 6], [7, 8]])\n",
    "\n",
    "matrix_sum = tf.add(matrix_a, matrix_b)\n",
    "Here, matrix_sum will be a new matrix with elements [6, 8] and [10, 12].\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix Multiplication:\n",
    "Matrix multiplication (also known as matrix dot product) involves multiplying rows of one matrix with \n",
    "columns of another matrix to generate a resulting matrix. In TensorFlow, you can use the tf.matmul() \n",
    "function or the @ operator for matrix multiplication. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "matrix_c = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n",
    "matrix_d = tf.constant([[5, 6], [7, 8]])\n",
    "\n",
    "matrix_product = tf.matmul(matrix_c, matrix_d)\n",
    "# Alternatively: matrix_product = matrix_c @ matrix_d\n",
    "The resulting matrix_product will be a new matrix based on the multiplication of the input matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Element-wise Operations:\n",
    "Element-wise operations involve applying an operation to each corresponding element of two matrices to \n",
    "create a new matrix with the same dimensions. TensorFlow provides various element-wise operations like addition,\n",
    "subtraction, multiplication, division, and more using functions like tf.add(), tf.subtract(), tf.multiply(),\n",
    "and tf.divide(). For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "matrix_e = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n",
    "matrix_f = tf.constant([[5, 6], [7, 8]])\n",
    "\n",
    "element_wise_result = tf.multiply(matrix_e, matrix_f)\n",
    "Here, element_wise_result will be a new matrix with elements [5, 12] and [21, 32], which are the products of \n",
    "corresponding elements from matrix_e and matrix_f.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, TensorFlow provides intuitive and efficient functions for matrix addition, multiplication,\n",
